Starting from general todo:<br>
&#x2605 Make both sites mobile and desktop compatible (ugh)<br>
&#x2605 Add tags<br>
&#x2605 Add robots.txt (maybe)<br>
&#x2605 Add obfuscation (this part will be much fun!)<br>
&#x2605 Finalize style sheet for vorskla.org<br>
&#x2605 Finalize style sheet for the burnessecurity.org<br>
&#x2605 Spellcheck EVERYTHING!!!<br>
&#x219D dont really care about spelling that much just yet - I want everything to work first<br>
&#x2605 Sort through and finalize content decisions<br>
&#x2605 Add graphics<br>
&#x219D Turns out I am a perfectionist in certain things (like creating graphichs) and if I start working on it now these projects will never get anywhere...<br>

<p>On the bright side, I think things will be much easier this time around, since I have actually created a style sheet that all pages will be using for a given website. This way properties of elements can all live in a centralized location and are easy to modify.<br>
Down side is that it almost like it's own language (that I don't speak) - what makes it harder is that I am defiently NOT an artist :)</p>
<p>Eventually, I will be hosting things on my own server, but for that to occur I need to scrounge up and purchase hardware (own server is going to be glorious!). For now, though, github and aws are going to work just fine.</p>

		<p>01/29/2018: accumulating interesting "lessons learned"</p> 
	<div class="notes"> ubuntu + Apache + wsgi + python - some serious lessons were learned.<br>
		wsgi works out of box no problems (at least there were none installing and enabling it this time around). Python testpage worked - much happy! Moving on to writing some meaningful code hit a snag - it refused to see my python import. <p>import requests - to be specific :)</p>I dug that out of apache error logs and now I wish I have spent an extra minute to read through the rest of the errors... wsgi mod was installed alright - for python two, and what I was trying to import is python3 only. <br>
		That about covers the main laughing, I mean, learning points here. Oh, and I took down the two test servers I have in AWS (apperently they ALSO charge by dns request - yeh, it's not a lot, but still! So much for the free tier... and for domains not costing anything after purchase...<br>
		Well, I'm learning... :) </div>
