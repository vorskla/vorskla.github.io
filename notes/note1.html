Starting from general todo:<br>
&#x2605 Make both sites mobile and desktop compatible (ugh)<br>
&#x2605 Add tags<br>
&#x2605 Add robots.txt (maybe)<br>
&#x2605 Add obfuscation (this part will be much fun!)<br>
&#x2605 Finalize style sheet for vorskla.org<br>
&#x2605 Finalize style sheet for the burnessecurity.org<br>
&#x2605 Spellcheck EVERYTHING!!!<br>
&#x219D dont really care about spelling that much just yet - I want everything to work first<br>
&#x2605 Sort through and finalize content decisions<br>
&#x2605 Add graphics<br>
&#x219D Turns out I am a perfectionist in certain things (like creating graphichs) and if I start working on it now these projects will never get anywhere...<br>

<div class="notes">
<p>On the bright side, I think things will be much easier this time around, since I have actually created a style sheet that all pages will be using for a given website. This way properties of elements can all live in a centralized location and are easy to modify.<br>
Down side is that it almost like it's own language (that I don't speak) - what makes it harder is that I am defiently NOT an artist :)</p>
