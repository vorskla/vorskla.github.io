      <p>I was named Olena, born in the Soviet Union right as it was falling appart, with a mid-line defect. Ukrainian with a cleft palet and a list of other issues but the familly decided not to give the baby up (though the option was kindly mentioned by the nurses). This child continued growing, life-loving, friendly and kind until about the age of three. Being a Ukrainian with a facial deformity apperently was a crime punishable by mokery, bullying and abuse. But all of that is in the past. Stan Lee and Stephen Hawking are my heroes. I am very passionate about causes, such as people (to include women) in stem. I'm sure my time in the Army going to Iraq, Afghanistant and serving on the mexican border ission helped me improve my character and grow as a person and a human.
	  And on with the story...
		Yaroslava Teslia was my first friend. I was lucky to gain more wonderful friends as the time went on - Anna, Liuba, Marina, Karina really made a big difference as if it was not for them I would have never went outside other tha to drag myself to school. <br> This was the time when I wrote down my first story. And then my second. Many more were imagined. </p>
      <p>I eventually relocated to United States finishing shooling there. Few more stories were written Joined United States Army at 18 going to Iraq soon after. Mexican Border mission after that followed by Afghanistan. About the time when my stories stopped. Finished my education upon my return and have been working ever since. </p>
		<p>Mental health was not going so good for me - depressions, suicide issues and two hospital stays, but still hanging in there. Going to work on learning how to be happy. Story telling has always been my passion and tinkering with art my hobby - people seemed to like it. Lets not forget about code. Really getting back to Story telling (just like Stan Lee one day, right? lolz)  and coding now, as there is nothing stopping me anymore, if ever (lol). Will give several stories a shot for starters and if only Netflix or Amazon would turn 'em into TV Shows I could almost die happy.
		Oh, and lets not forget application development. Working prototype statuses: https://appdevvorskla.tumblr.com/post/181827593691/picture-worth-a-thousand-words

		<p> I'll have more samples of my work as I continue building things up, from the ground up sometimes - like this website  (hosted on github and made with... welll... all these details can go to a different sections. ). </p>
