      <p>I was named Olena, born in the Soviet Union right as it was falling appart, with a mid-line defect. Ukrainian with a cleft palet and a list of other issues but the familly decided not to give the baby up (though the option was kindly mentioned by the nurses). This child continued growing, life-loving, friendly and kind until about the age of three. Being a Ukrainian with a facial deformity apperently was a crime punishable by mokery, bullying and abuse.
		Yaroslava Teslia was my first friend. I was lucky to gain more wonderful friends as the time went on - Anna, Liuba, Marina, Karina really made a big difference as if it was not for them I would have never went outside other tha to drag myself to school. <br> This was the time when I wrote down my first story. And then my second. Many more were imagined. </p>
      <p>I eventually relocated to United States finishing shooling there. Few more stories were written Joined United States Army at 18 going to Iraq soon after. Mexican Border mission after that followed by Afghanistan. About the time when my stories stopped. Finished my education upon my return and have been working ever since. </p>
		<p>Mental health was not going so good for me - depressions, suicide issues and two hospital stays, but still hanging in there. Going to work on learning how to be happy. Story telling has always been my passion and tinkering with art my hobby - people seemed to like it. Really getting back to Story telling now, as there is nothing stopping me anymore, if ever. Will give several stories a shot for starters and if only Netflix or Amazon would turn 'em into TV Shows I could almost die happy.</p>

        <p>This is the latest "draft" of my personal website.<br> I will continue to improve on this as the time allows. <br>I do have work to do, as my morgage will not pay itself, unfortunatly.</p>
